# Architecture decision records

Architecture decision records (ADRs) capture decisions that constrain multiple
parts of the platform or would be expensive to reverse after domain work
begins.

## Status values

- **Proposed** — under review and not yet binding.
- **Accepted** — the repository must follow the decision.
- **Superseded** — replaced by a newer ADR that links back to it.
- **Rejected** — considered but intentionally not selected.

Changing an accepted decision requires a new ADR. The new record must explain
the compatibility and migration consequences and mark the old record as
superseded; accepted records are not silently rewritten.
